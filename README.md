=============

Create a gallery that shows on click a new image and description.

###How does it work?
Pull the Repo and work through the Issues on a branch. 
```
git pull [--rebase]
git checkout -b <your_branch>
```
Push and create a Pull Request from the branch when you are done and want feedback or have questions.
```
git push origin <your_branch>
```
Only merge on Github when you see an Emoji in the comment.
